# Shuffled-systems
This directory contains the MATLAB source codes used to produce the result of the paper: 

Georges Aazan, Antoine Girard, Luca Greco, Paolo Mason. Stability of Shuffled Switched Linear Systems: A Joint Spectral Radius Approach. Automatica, Elsevier, In press.

To produce the results of the first (second) example, one shall excute "first(second)_example.m".

The file "PowerSet.m" is downloaded from mathworks.com and used to build our results.

Questions and bug reports can be sent to georges.aazan@lsv.fr.
